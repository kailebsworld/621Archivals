# About 621 ARCHIVAL

621 ARCHIVAL makes limited runs of printed matter and garments. our approach is editorial: we treat merch like a publication and clothing like a uniform for life in public. short runs. clear statements. modest production.

we make work that sits between a protest poster, an art book, and functional clothing. short runs. clear statements. modest production.
